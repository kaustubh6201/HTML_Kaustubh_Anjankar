        Once upon a time, all the birds - the swans, cranes,<br> 
			parrots, cuckoos, owls, peacocks, doves and the rest of them -<br> 
			decided to meet. They had to discuss a subject of most importance.<br> 
			Unfortunately, no crow had joined yet, but they could not wait any longer. <br>
			They debated, "Garuda, who is the king of all birds, is always busy in <br>
			serving his master. He has neither the time, nor the interest to bother <br>
			about us! There is no point in having a king who does not protect and <br>
			remains at the position of the king only as a namesake." <br>
